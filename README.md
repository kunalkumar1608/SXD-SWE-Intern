## Math and Programming Exercises
Assume your team is building an application that attempts to find the optimal solution to a multivariate equation given a set of constraints. Feel free to solve the below in your programming language of choice.

### Part I: Math

Consider the following problem:

$Min Z = –3X1 + X2$

Subject to the following:

$X_{1} + X_{2} ≤ 5$
$2X_{1} + X_{2} ≤ 8$
$X_{1} ≥ 0, X_{2} ≥ 0$

What is the optimal solution?

**Answer** :


### Part 2: Programming

Write a program that can iteratively (or recursively) solve for $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ for similar equations to the above. As a benchmark, when facing the following (similar) problem.

$Max Z = 3X1 + 4X2$

Subject to the following:

$15X1 + 10X2 ≤ 300$
$2.5X_{1} + 5X_{2} ≤ 110$
$X_{1} ≥ 0, X_{2} ≥ 0$

your program should output $X_{1} = 8, X_{2} = 18, and \t Z = 96$ as the optimal solution. Please focus on writing your program with best OOP practices in mind (class design, DRY, handling static variables, etc.).
